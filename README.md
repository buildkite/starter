# Buildkite Starter Pipeline

[![Add to Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/button.svg)](https://buildkite.com/new)

This repository is an example [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) pipeline to help new users understand how pipelines work.

The pipeline is platform agnostic, which means it can run on any infrastructure. Its behavior is defined in [.buildkite/pipeline.yml](.buildkite/pipeline.yml), including steps to build, test, and deploy. These steps describe launching a shiny new rocket to the moon. 🚀🌕

## Create a pipeline

You'll need a Buildkite account and a running agent to use the pipeline. If you need help setting up Buildkite, see [Getting started](https://buildkite.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started).

With Buildkite setup, you can quickly create a new pipeline by selecting **Add to Buildkite**. This prefills the pipeline details using [template.yml](.buildkite/template.yml) and includes a command to upload the pipeline definition in [pipeline.yml](.buildkite/pipeline.yml).
